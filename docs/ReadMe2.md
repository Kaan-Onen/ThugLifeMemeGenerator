😎 The Thug Life Meme Generator 
Welcome to the ultimate Computer Vision project! We’re using cutting-edge tech to automatically drop "Thug Life" assets onto faces with pinpoint precision. Whether it's a static boss move or a video that triggers on a blink, this Python-powered tool has you covered.✨  


🚀 Key Features  
🖼️ Static Image Overlay: Automatically scales and rotates assets based on the distance and angle between the eyes. No manual tweaking needed!  
🎥 Video Magic: Real-time processing that detects when you blink. Close your eyes, and boom—the meme appears.  
📍 Smart Anchoring: Assets are locked to specific facial landmarks, ensuring they don't just float around.  
🔄 Dynamic Rotation: Whether your head is tilted or you're leaning back, the assets adjust their angle using eye-coordinate math for a perfect fit.  


🛠️ The Tech Stack  
This project is built with Python and a trio of powerhouse libraries:  

MediaPipe: The "eyes" of the project, used for high-fidelity face landmarking.  
🧐OpenCV: The engine for image and video manipulation.   
🎬NumPy: The "brain" handling all the coordinate geometry and matrix transformations.

🧠 How the Magic HappensThe project leverages the MediaPipe FaceLandmarker to map the face in 3D space. The secret sauce lives in vision_utils.py, which handles:  
Scaling: Resizes the asset dynamically based on how close you are to the camera.  
Rotation: Uses $cv2.getRotationMatrix2D$ to calculate the exact tilt between your eyes.  
Alpha Blending: Uses PNG transparency (the alpha channel) so the shades look like they're actually on your face, not just pasted on top.🎨  


🎬 Getting Started  
1. Install Dependencies Get your environment ready with one command:pip install -r requirements.txt 💻  
2. Models and Assets *   
Drop the face_landmarker.task model into the models/ folder.  
Throw your swagger (glasses, hats, etc.) and your test videos into the assets/ folder. 📂  
3. Run the Scripts *
